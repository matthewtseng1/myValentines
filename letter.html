                        <strong>Dear Ela Sismanyazici.</strong>
                        <p>
                            How are you my love? Happy valantine's day. I love you so much. 
                            I am so lucky to have you in my life, standing by my side thoughout tough times. 
                            You are probably the best thing that has ever  happened to me. I know it's hard for us 
                            to date, especially for these few couple of months, with my parents not allowing me to date, but 
                            I hope we can continue to florish this relationship. I love you from the deepest, deepest, from 
                            my right ventricle, to my aorta. I love you so much my dear. Seni seviyorum. 
                        </p>
